I am interested in exploring novel deep learning algorithms and architectures and their potential to improve our understanding of cerbral organoid phenotyping and drug discovery.

I have also worked on multi-agent systems, agent-based modelling and simulations, optimisation and machine learning, and their applications in the fields of swarm robotics and decarbonisation.
