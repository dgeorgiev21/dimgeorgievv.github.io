My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial inteligence, tissue analysis, brain research and precision medicine. More specifically, I am exploring novel deep learning algorithms and architectures for cerbral organoid phenotyping and drug discovery.

Previously, I have worked on multi-agent systems, agent-based modelling and simulations, optimisation and machine learning, and their applications in the fields of swarm robotics, operation optimisation and decarbonisation.
