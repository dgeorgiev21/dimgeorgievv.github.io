I am a PhD student in AI & ML at the [AI4Healt CDT](https://ai4health.io/) at Imperial College London where I am working on deep learning for cerebral organoid phenotyping and drug discovery under the supervision of [Prof. Mauricio Barahona](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.barahona) and [Prof. Molly Stevens](https://www.stevensgroup.org).

Prior to that, I obtained an MMath degree in Mathematics with First Class Honours at the University of Southampton, where I specialised at Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science and Theoretical Physics. During my studies, I specialised in Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science and Theoretical Physics. I also worked as a Research Assistance Intern at the Agents, Interaction and Complexity ([AIC](https://www.aic.ecs.soton.ac.uk/)) research group at the University of Southampton for almost two years. My research work focused on multi-agent systems, agent-based modelling and simulations, optimisation and machine learning, and their applications in the fields of swarm robotics and decarbonisation. I also have good working experience in the areas of Machine Learning, Data Science and Full-Stack Software Development.
